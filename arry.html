            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A tree is a tall plant that can live for a very long time. It has a
                single stem or trunk and branches that support leaves. Beneath the ground, a tree has a root system that
                acts as an anchor and stores the water and nutrients the plant needs to grow.
                One of the ways we distinguish trees from other plants is their thick and rigid ligneous tissues, which
                we know as wood. And of course, different tree species are made up of different types of wood.
                Ultimately, while it's useful to have a basic tree definition, as with all nature we need to delve
                deeper to understand the sheer variety of trees in the forest.
                Let's explore some of the other features that make trees such a special and important part of the
                natural environment. </p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">What is a Lake?</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A lake is a body of water that is surrounded by land. There are millions
                of lakes in the world. They are found on every continent and in every kind of environment—in mountains
                and deserts, on plains, and near seashores.
                Lakes vary greatly in size. Some measure only a few square meters and are small enough to fit in your
                backyard. Such small lakes are often referred to as ponds. Other lakes are so big that they are called
                seas. The Caspian Sea, in Europe and Asia, is the world’s largest lake, with an area of more than
                370,000 square kilometers (143,000 square miles).

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">What is a Lion?</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to
                Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy
                tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have
                a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few
                adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on
                large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when
                opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, lions typically do not actively seek out and
                prey on humans.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Lions are the only known cat species where individuals roar together - with even young cubs joining in
                with their mews. The calling sequence usually lasts about 40 seconds. A group of lions, also called 'a
                pride', often roar together to mark their territory - a roar can be heard from 5 miles away.
